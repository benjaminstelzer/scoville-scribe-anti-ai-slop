# Routing case: research-answer

## Scenario

The user asks for current source-backed research and a decision-ready recommendation but not a separately constrained report artifact.

## Question

Decide which available Scoville Skill Cores apply to this task and which Scribe
references apply if Scribe is selected. Do not perform the described task.

Return exactly one JSON object with these keys in order and no additional text:

```json
{
  "skills": ["zero or more available Skill names in catalog order"],
  "scribe_references": ["zero or more Scribe reference paths in Core routing order"]
}
```
